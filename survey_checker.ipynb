      "The US government could implement a comprehensive carbon pricing system, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program, that puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions across all major sectors of the economy. This market-based approach would incentivize businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint by making cleaner alternatives more economically attractive, while generating revenue that could fund renewable energy infrastructure, support affected communities, or be returned to citizens as dividends. Such a policy would harness market forces to drive innovation and emission reductions efficiently across the entire economy.\n",

This market-based approach incentivizes businesses and consumers to reduce fossil fuel use, invest in renewable energy, and innovate cleaner technologies. Revenue generated can fund green infrastructure, subsidize low-income households, and offset the transition costs.

      "You weren't wrong to decline being in the wedding party—it's reasonable to set boundaries around your time and energy, especially as an introvert. However, your friend's hurt feelings are also understandable, as they may have interpreted your decline as lack of care rather than self-care. This seems like a communication breakdown where both perspectives are valid. Consider reaching out to explain your reasoning and reaffirm your friendship, as 15 years of friendship deserves that effort.\n",
